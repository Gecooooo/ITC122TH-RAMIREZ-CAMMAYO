The team was also joined by Dr. Joan Propst, who played a significant role in spearheading the establishment of the International Nursing Program in the Philippines in 2005. The primary objective of the visit was to explore avenues for enriching the educational experience for nursing students through the 3+ 1 pathway under the INP.</p>
      <p>The AU-INP delegates were welcomed by the WVU School of Nursing community. The activities were led by the Associate Dean of Undergraduate Programs at WVU, Dr. Brad Phillips, who ensured that there would be productive discussions with the officials and faculty members of WVU in line with the integration of international perspectives and best practices in the nursing curriculum. Dr. Tara Hulsey, Dean, and E. Jane Martin Endowed Professor at WVU School of Nursing expressed her enthusiasm for solidifying the foundations of the partnership. During the meeting, she conveyed her commitment to ensure a smooth transition for the first batch of students who are set to finish their final year at WVU by the Fall Semester of SY 2024-2025. The delegation also had the privilege of meeting with President Gordon Gee of West Virginia University, as well as Dr. Clay Marsh, Chancellor and Executive Dean for Health Sciences. With their extensive knowledge and experience as administrators, they bring forth mutual goals, shared values, and a long-term vision to sustain and expand the partnership.</p>
